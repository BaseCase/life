# Conway's Game of Life

## TODO - for v1

- [X] match playing area to window size
- [X] randomly generate starting board on launch (maybe each cell has a 5% chance of being alive? something like that?)
- [ ] apply game of life rules to each cell and animate
- [ ] spacebar pauses/unpauses game
- [ ] when paused, you can edit the board by moving cursor around and toggling cells
- [ ] when screen shrinks, maintain offscreen board but don't try to render
- [ ] when screen grows, increase board size to match
- [ ] unit tests (figure out how to do this in C)
- [ ] figure out configure/make/make install thing
- [ ] create homebrew formula
- [ ] submit to homebrew/games


## TODO - for later on

* allow scrolling viewport when board is larger than screen
* read starting board from a file
* save current position in a file
* mouse support for edit mode
* +/- speed up/slow down animation
